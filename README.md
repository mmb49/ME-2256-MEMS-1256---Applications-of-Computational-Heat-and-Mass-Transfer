# ME-2256-MEMS-1256---Applications-of-Computational-Heat-and-Mass-Transfer

This course a graduate and senior-level undergraduate course in the Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science department at the University of Pittsburgh that provides an introduction to the implementation of commercial and open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to solve complex, multi-physics, multi-scale engineering problems. Topics covered include mesh generation, discretization and input uncertainty, model selection for internal and external laminar and turbulent flow, conjugate heat transfer, multi-phase flow, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance/supercomputing. This repository contains the lecture slides, examples scripts and homework assignments.
